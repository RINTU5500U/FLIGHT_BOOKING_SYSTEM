# FLIGHT_BOOKING_SYSTEM

# This is a backend of a flight booking system where user can see all flight according to their choice of origin and destination and booking

<1ST OF ALL I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN [ Html, Css, Javascript, Python, Node.js, Express, Restful api, MVC pattern architecture, NoSQL [ MongoDB, Redis ], SQL [ MySQL, PostgreSQL ], AWS [ EC2, S3 ], Socket.IO, CI/CD pipeline, Docker, GIT, OOP concept, Basic DSA ]
SO THE THING IS LANGUAGE AND FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS DATABSES ARE LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE FOR EVERY DEVELOPER.
IT MEANS IF WE CAN DO A THING THEN WE CAN LEARN OR ACHIEVE MANY THINGS LIKE THAT AND I AM ALSO PASSIONATE FOR LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

<<TOOLS-AND-TECHNOLOGIES: 

    1. In this assignment i have used Node.js as backend language
    2. I have used Express.js.. Basically Express is a very popular framework of Node.js which is used 
    for devlop the backend of a web application
    3. I have used oSQL DB which is the primary database.
    4. I have optimized the api calls .
    5. All of the codes are written in proper fashion to increase readbility ..
    6. In this assignment i have used <REDIS> for web caching at the time of retrieve data 1st data will find from redis if there is no data then it will            
    automatically jump to our primary databases
    7. According to assignment I have used proper Authentication or authorization for updating and deleting the raw data.
    8. In this assignment i have used the industry level validation package <joi> for proper validation .
    9. In this assignment a user can retrieve the flight data by choosing origin & destination & departure as well as return date also 
    10. In this assignment i have used proper pagination to increase readbility
    11. By the help of redis it is faster to fetch data rather than hitting primary database.
    12. Here i have used <custom-id> package to create own Flight ticket number..
    13. By the help of <JWT(json web token)> authentication and authorization going very good in this assignment.
    14. Here i have create 2 types of user 1 is `User` & another is `Admin` . so normal user can't do those work which work `Admin` can do like 
    add flight, update flight incase of emergency, delete flight model also...
    15. I have used <CI/CD> pipelines to easily continuous deploy the project in any deploy platform like AWS EC2 / VERCEL / HEROKU / NETLIFY ...etc
    16. By the help of .yaml file in github and by the help of github action without delay we can continuous deploy any type of projects.
    17. I have test all the apis and apis are working fantastic ..
    18. Ihave used the <bcrypt> to hash the password and stored it in database securely
    
<<PROFFESSION:

    Currently, I am a Backend developer at @SIGNZY , full-stack web development using the MERN stack. Coding is my passion. Since childhood, I have been very fond of technology. I started coding during my graduation. At the same 
    time, learning HTML and CSS from youtube videos. I started liking the concept and wanted to become a Full-stack web developer. In july 2022, I came to know about FunctionUp via youtube ads, and at that time I began my journey 
    toward becoming a Full-stack web developer by help of FunctionUp and now i am joined @SIGNZY

    I have strong technology knowledge about [ Html, Css, Javascript, Python, Node.js, Express, Restful api, MVC pattern architecture, NoSQL [ MongoDB, Redis ], SQL [ MySQL, PostgreSQL ], AWS [ EC2, S3 ], Socket.IO, CI/CD 
    pipeline, Docker, GIT, OOP concept, Basic DSA ]
    I have done several types of robust backend projects with 2 frontend projects by using these skills.

    I hope to work in a dynamic organization that offers opportunities and helps in my overall growth and development alongside the organization.
